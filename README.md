# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone which allows users to create and view basic tweets.

The front-end was developed by me, using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, and AJAX.  The back-end was provided by Lighthouse Labs during their web development bootcamp.

## Final Product

Tweeter resizes based on window size, providing different viewing experiences for Desktop and Mobile users.
